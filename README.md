FlappyBird

Flappy Birds clone for Android

So, Flappy Birds was a major hit. That was an even more major under-statement. Anyway, one night after the game had gone
viral, I just thought I'd test myself to see how long I'd take to clone the game. It took me around three to four hours 
and this is the result. 
I didn't create the graphics for this game. Just grabbed resources from the internet. Hope you like it!

Just for the record, I'll never put this game online. I'll never make money out of this game. Enjoy!!!
